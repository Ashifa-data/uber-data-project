Uber EDA & Analysis Project
 Project Overview
This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to identify patterns, trends, and operational challenges. It also includes Excel analysis, SQL querying, and Python-based visualizations, all aimed at helping Uber improve ride availability and efficiency.

python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab for coding

MySQL / BigQuery for SQL analysis

MS Excel for initial exploration

PowerPoint for presentation

GitHub for version control

Key Analysis Performed
Excel:
Cleaned and filtered raw data

Checked for missing values

Performed pivot analysis and basic charts

SQL:
Used aggregate functions to analyze trips by status and pickup points

Queried peak hours and cancellation trends

Identified operational gaps

Python (EDA):
Cleaned dataset and handled datetime formats

Created visualizations like:

Trip Status Count

Pickup Point Distribution

Cancellation by Time Slot

Correlation Heatmap & Pair Plot

Derived actionable insights for Uber's operations

 Business Insights
Most ride cancellations happen during peak hours from airport to city.

High demandâ€“low availability gap seen during early morning and evening rush hours.

Drivers are fewer during airport pickups, especially in morning hours.

 Suggested Business Solutions
Improve driver availability at airports during peak demand

Introduce incentives for early morning shifts

Build a predictive demand model for proactive driver assignment
